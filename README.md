# Autoradiography-Timer

Use Labview to build a UI, and help interaction with hardwares.  
Also put my ExpressPCB file here. (used to make an Arduino shield)  

Hardware:
1. Arduino Uno  
2. Padel  
3. Pinch Valve  
4. Double-Channel Relay  
5. Synringe pump  

Basic Functions:
1. A UI to minitor the status of cerebral blood flow sampling  
2. Control Valve with padel  
3. At time 0, start syringe pump  
4. record the time when padel is pressed  
5. at the end of the sampling, drive guillotine and output sampling file.  


PS: Most Info are stored elsewhere. Here is a place to show final outcome.
